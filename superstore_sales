Superstore Sales

Brief Summary: 
EXCEL - =right( , ),=left( , ),=mid( , , ), =concatenate( , , , , , ), =datevalue()
MYSQL - WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, CTEs, JOINS, aggregate functions, subqueries, ALTER, ADD, SET, RENAME, CONSTRAINTS, LOAD DATA, data types, IN, ON
TABLEAU - dashboard, visualization

Summary:
This is my first sql/tableau project where I took two datasets off kaggle.com, superstore stores and us_population_estimate_2019. 
I first started in MYSQL with creating a database store and creating a table, sales, to store my superstore sales into. 

This is where my first problem was. At this current time, I do not know how to use python/pandas to clean the data before being able to put it into my table.
My first issue was the formatting of the order_date and ship_date with the dates being in DD/MM/YYYY. I don't think this is recognized in MYSQL so I opened up the csv
into google sheets and decided to clean the data there. 

This is where my next issue was. Dates were either being recognized as date values and some being recognized as text values so the function =datevalue() was giving
me an error for atleast half of the dates. So what I did, which probably has a better solution, was that I used =right(), =mid(), =left() to split the dates into number
values into different columns. I then used =concatenate() with a cell with the value '-' to get '2017-05-16' so that dates were actually in the right format. I then 
special pasted the results into the actual order_date and ship_date columns.

I used LOAD DATA to get the data into the table sales. I wasn't happy with the sales column having the same name as the table so I used ALTER to rename the column.
I then did a bunch of random queries that I thought would be helpful to visualize. Some basic queries involving WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, CTEs, JOINS,
aggregate functions, and subqueries.

After that I thought that having US populations to compare to the amount of customers from each state would be interesting to have so I got the us_population_estimate_2019 
from kaggle.com and added that to the database.

Since I was adding another table to the database I wanted to add foreign keys and primary keys to the two tables. I use ALTER, ADD CONSTRAINTS, ADD FOREIGN KEY, 
REFERENCES, and RENAME. 

I imported the tables and a couple of queries into Tableau to visualize a dashboard for sales from 2015 to 2018. 

What I learned from this project is more experience with utilizing Tableau to visualize a dashboard with different techniques. I also learned that more uses of 
the different clauses in MYSQL. Some things that I will work on in the future are better uses of CTEs, subqueries, and windows functions. There are also better alternatives
to what I'm trying to solve. Another thing that I could work on is to have a better plan to tackling a business task. I came into this project without a solid idea
of what I wanted to do with it. I didn't really ASK to see what the issue was. I also didn't prepare for all the data that I could have added to the database to get 
more queries. My ASK and PREPARE phase wasn't as planned as it should have been which caused the CLEANING and ANALYZING to be a little back and forth.

/*

The date value for column order_date and ship_date was an incorrect date value
because the format was DD/MM/YYYY. At this current time I thought the easiest solution was to open
the csv in Google Sheets and clean it up there which my next problem came. 

The dates in the superstore_sales csv were in two different formats, 
one being dd/mm/yyyy as a date and dd/mm/yyyy being recognized as a text. Because of this =datevalue() 
was not able to get a date value from atleast half of the dates.

What I did was probably not the best way but what worked for me with my current knowledge was to use 
=right([cell],4) to get the year in one column as S1
=mid([cell],4,2) to get the month in the next column S2
=left([cell],2) to get the day in the following column S3
I also had a cell with the text '-' X1

I then used =concatenate(S1,$X$1,S2,$X$1,S3) to get the text YYYY-MM-DD
I then used =datevalue(previous_function) to the the text into a value ex:42659
which I then replaced all the dates for columns order_date with their corresponding datevalue.
I also did the same for ship_date. I then formatted the two columns into YYYY-MM-DD.
