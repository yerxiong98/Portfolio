# Dealership Car Sales Project

#Tableau - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yer.xiong/viz/DealershipReport/Dashboard1?publish=yes

#TLDR - In my previous projects I didn't know what the purpose of using a cte was and how much more organized and easier it was than making multiple subqueries in the same select code. Just a 
#project with a lot more practice with cleaning data. There is still a lot more that I need to work on with cleaning data. My next project will probably be working with dirty data. A lot more 
#experience with using CTEs, CASE, subqueries.

#Simple cleanup on file car_sales_1.csv



import pandas as pd

#nans function to return any rows that had any null values in them so I could decide what I wanted to do to them
#I used this function on other python cleaning code except this one but I wanted to write this function here in case I needed it.
def nans(df): 
    return df[df.isnull().any(axis=1)]


cs = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/yerxiong98/Desktop/project/car/car_sales_1.csv')

#change format from dd/mm/yyyy to yyyy/mm/dd
cs['Date']=pd.to_datetime(cs['Date'],dayfirst=True)

#engine name had a different name for it so I replaced it with a simpler term
cs['Engine'] = cs['Engine'].str.replace('Double√Ç','Dual')
cs.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)


cs['Customer Name'].fillna('Unknown',inplace=True)
cs['CouncilArea'].fillna('Unknown',inplace=True)

cs.to_csv('C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/car_sales_1.csv', index=False, sep=',')

--@block I wanted to make another column that was just a concatenate of company, model, year, and transmission
update up_car_sales

A couple queries that I decided not to use in my dashboard but may end up adding them, unsure

--@block which 10 make/model/year/trans made the most money in the last 12 months recorded?
select make_model_year_trans, sum(price_in_thousands) as total_made from up_car_sales
where date between '2017-3-17' and '2018-3-18'
group by make_model_year_trans
order by total_made desc
limit 10

--@block what year of cars not made in 2017 are still sold in 2017?
select distinct make_model_year_trans from up_car_sales
where year(date) = '2017'
and year <> '2017'


--@block list of customers who have not purchased the last year
select cust_id from up_car_sales
where date not between '2017-03-17' and '2018-03-18';

Main queries that I used for the visualization

--@block what type of bodystyle/transmission/color do male/female prefer

------------------------------------------
--@block Just to double check if my query was actually getting the data that I wanted

--@block Just to double check if my query was actually getting the data that I wanted
